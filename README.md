Algorithmic Trading
==============================

> Exploratory analysis of historical stock and options data

In this project our aim is to explore and analyse financial instruments (stocks and options in particular) and to develop profitable trading strategies. To that end, we focused on the relation between price time series and factors such as market volatility, interest rates, and various economic indicators.  
You can browse our Jupyter notebooks [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lambdaclass/finance/ergodicity).

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- pipenv

For backtesting, set `$OPTIONS_DATA_PATH` to the appropriate data dir.  
To use the data scraper, set `$SAVE_DATA_PATH`. By default, it will save data to `./data/scraped`.

**HINT**: store environment variables in an `.env` file and pipenv will load them automatically when using `make env`.

## Usage

### Create environment and download dependencies

```shell
$> make init
```

### Activate environment

```shell
$> make env
```

### Run tests

```shell
$> make test
```

### Scrape data (supported scrapers: CBOE, Tiingo)

```shell
$> make scrape symbols=msft,goog scraper=cboe

$> make scrape symbols=voo scraper=tiingo
```

### Run backtester with benchmark strategy

```shell
$> make bench
```
